# 适配 openGauss 的 exporter<a name="ZH-CN_TOPIC_0291959509"></a>

基于 postgres_exporter-0.8.0 适配 openGauss。

针对 postgres_exporter.go 文件做修改。

## 数据库用户<a name="section82326216206"></a>

新建一个 exporter 的数据库用户，需要**sysadmin**权限，否则有些系统视图无法获取数据。

新建用户之前，需要修改加密参数，由 sha256 改成 md5。

password_encryption_type = 0

## 版本号适配<a name="section1570064418206"></a>

```
//var versionRegex = regexp.MustCompile(`^\w+ ((\d+)(\.\d+)?(\.\d+)?)`)
//var lowestSupportedVersion = semver.MustParse("9.1.0")

//opengauss
var versionRegex = regexp.MustCompile(`^\(?\w+ ((\d+)(\.\d+)?(\.\d+)?)`)
var lowestSupportedVersion = semver.MustParse("1.0.0")
```

## 系统视图适配<a name="section1664515378225"></a>

pg_stat_archiveropengauss 不支持该系统视图，去掉。
