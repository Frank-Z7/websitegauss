### 4. Starting Your Contribution

#### 4.1 Assigning an Issue to Yourself

Firstly find the Issue list for the openGauss community: https://gitee.com/organizations/opengauss/issues

If you want to process one of the Issues, you can assign it to yourself. Enter `/assign` in the comment box, and then the robot will assign the issue to you.
Participants communicate and discuss on each issue page. You can leave your opinions in the comment box.

#### 4.2 Submitting Issue

If you are going to report bugs or submit requirements to the community, please submit Issue on the corresponding repository of openGauss community.
If you don't know which repository the bug or requirement belongs to, please go to the [Community](https://gitee.com/opengauss/community) repository to submit Issue.
You can also contribute your own opinions or suggestions to the opengauss community in the form of Issue.
Please refer to [Issue Submit Guide](https://gitee.com/opengauss/community/blob/master/contributors/issue-submit.en.md) for Issue submission.

#### 4.3 Submitting Pull Request

When you submit a Pull Request, it means that you have started to contribute code to the community. See openGauss Community Pull Request Submission Guide for more details.
If a large amount of code needs to be submitted at a time, it is recommended that you break down large content into a series of logically small content and submit them separately to help reviewers understand your ideas.
If your Pull Request does not draw enough attention, you can seek help through the Mailing Lists or IRC channels of different SIGs.

#### 4.4 Reviewing Code

openGauss is an open community, we hope that all participants in the community are active reviewers.
[The Gentle Art Of Patch Review](https://sage.thesharps.us/2014/09/01/the-gentle-art-of-patch-review/) puts forward a series of review focuses, explaining that the review is to promote the participation of new contributors and prevent the contributors from being overwhelmed by subtle errors at the beginning.

### 5. Community Membership
